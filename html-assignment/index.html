    <p1>My name is Gavrill I am an IMD student at Algonquin college, who is planning on taking the skills learnt among the courses learnt, which are from: graphic design, web development, photography, video editing, etc. This is something I am very interested in because I can seek demanding jobs that look for those skills and apply it to my own projects aswell.</p1>
